                        A Dutch painter who produced some of the most cherished and esteemed works of art in history. His paintings are among the greatest masterpieces in the best museums in the world, despite the fact that only about 36 of them have survived. The majority of Vermeer's later works, for which he is best known, show images of everyday life in domestic settings, although he started his career in the early 1650s by painting expansive biblical and mythological scenes. The purity of light and shape in these pieces is striking; they exude a calm, timeless feeling of dignity. Vermeer also painted allegorical subjects and cityscapes.     </div>

                        A Japanese artist from the Edo period who painted and printed in ukiyo-e. He was the foremost authority on Chinese painting in Japan at the time. Hokusai was born in Edo, which is now Tokyo. He is most renowned for his woodblock print series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, which was published about 1831 and included the famous and well-known print, The Great Wave off Kanagawa, which was made in the 1820s. The "Thirty-Six Views" were produced by Hokusai in reaction to a surge in domestic travel as well as a personal fixation with Mount Fuji.                    </div>

                        A late 19th-century Filipino painter, sculptor, and political figure during the Philippine Revolution. He was among the first Filipino artists to receive recognition.
                        The Propaganda Movement members' memoirs highlight the celebration that followed his gold medal at the 1884 Madrid Exposition of Fine Arts and fellow Filipino painter Félix Resurrección Hidalgo's silver medal. The other Illustrados toasted to the two painters' good health and the fraternity between Spain and the Philippines.                  </div>

                        A French painter who pioneered new approaches by choosing topics from the events and situations of his own time and by rejecting conventional representational techniques. His 1863 exhibition at the Salon des Refusés, Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (Luncheon on the Grass), sparked excitement among the young artists who would later form the core of the Impressionist movement and indignation among critics. Olympia (1863) and A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (1882) are two of his other well-known pieces.      </div>
