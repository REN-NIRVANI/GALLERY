                        Depicts a young woman in a small, dim area that is intimate and solely focused on her by the viewer. She is dressed in a gold jacket with a white collar that is visible underneath, a blue and gold turban, and the pearl earring that serves as the title. She is not focused on a routine task and is not conscious of her audience, in contrast to many of Vermeer's subjects. She instead turns her head over her shoulder, meeting the viewer's gaze with her eyes wide and mouth parted as though she were going to speak, as if she were caught in a moment.                    </div>

                        This woodblock print is regarded as a masterpiece of world art because of its amazing composition, which is credited with inspiring Debussy's La Mer (The Sea) and Rilke's Der Berg (The Mountain). Through deft use of perspective, Hokusai transformed Japan's tallest mountain into a little triangular mound inside the wave's depression. With a palette of indigo and imported Prussian blue, the artist became well-known for his landscape paintings.                    </div>

                        Juan Luna, a Filipino painter, created this well-known piece in 1884. After losing in the amphitheater, Roman gladiators were stripped of their armor in the "spoliarium." The political and cultural climate of the Philippines during its colonial era is reflected in Luna's artwork. Luna used it to express his disapproval of the repressive colonial authority and the exploitation of the Filipino people during the time when the Philippines was ruled by Spain. Luna's strong feeling of nationalism and his wish for justice and freedom for his fellow Filipinos are both conveyed in the artwork.                    </div>

                        When Manet was near death, he created this final masterpiece. He went back to his favorite topic in it, which was the celebration of Parisian life. Bars, cafés, and dance halls were the settings for many of the Impressionists' most well-known scenes, which frequently featured people having fun. The most well-known of the café-concert venues, the Folies-Bergère offered both refreshments and entertainment. The legs of a trapeze performer are visible in the top left-hand corner of the image, providing an example of this type of entertainment.                    </div>
